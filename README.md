# Portfolio-Return-and-Risk-Calculator

Here, I have created the Portfolio-Return-and-Risk-Calculator project using Python and added 
Covariance Matrix: The portfolio risk calculation uses the full covariance matrix to account for correlations between stocks, giving a more accurate risk assessment than just weighted averages
Monte Carlo Simulation: Generates thousands of random portfolio allocations to find the most efficient combinations of stocks
Sharpe Ratio: Measures the risk-adjusted return (higher is better)
Efficient Frontier: The curve showing portfolios with maximum return for a given level of risk
These features are in my project.

This tool provides both basic portfolio statistics and advanced optimization techniques to help you understand and improve your investment strategy.
